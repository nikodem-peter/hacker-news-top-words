* ~~pass acceptance test with mocked most recent stories~~
### make it fast
* implement call parallelism - think through various approaches, 
    will be influenced by Historical top words 
* performance metrics

### make it work
* explore askhn, showhn, jobs, new, best and top stories candidate eliminations - seems relatively ineffective
* ~~added HTML escaping~~
* ~~add new stopwords and separators mostly related to HTML and url links.~~

* parallelize HN item retrieval
